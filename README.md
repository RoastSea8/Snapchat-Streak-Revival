# Snapchat-Streak-Revival
### Purpose:
* To allow the user to restore his or her streaks ðŸ”¥ in a convenient manner
  - Enter information required by Snapchat's support website into certain variables only once
  - Have the program automatically enter all these details for future use thereafter
### How to setup:
* Install Selenium by going to your command line and running `pip install selenium`
* Open the `Snapchat-Streak-Revival.py` file and fill in the following information - you only have to do this **once**
  - `username` = "Your Snapchat username (no spaces), or write 'none'"
  - `emailAddress` = "Email associated with your Snapchat account (if applicable)"
  - `mobileNumber` = "Include country code (e.g. +1 202 555 0192)"
  - `device` = "Include brand, model and model series"
  - *Note:* You can fill in `friendsUsername` and `streaksLength` in this step as well, but you don't have to
### How to run:
* Run the file directly from an IDE or open command line and run `python3 typeracer.py` or `python typeracer.py` depending on your OS and python version
* If you hadn't previously entered your friend's username or the length of the old streak, you will be prompted to do so now
### Prospects:
* Adding CAPTCHA bypass to further increase convenience
